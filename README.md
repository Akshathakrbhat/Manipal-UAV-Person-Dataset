### <center>Large scale UAV dataset for Person detection </center>

<p align="justify"> &emsp; Intelligent UAV video analysis has drawn the attention of a large number of researchers due to the increasing popularity of unmanned aerial vehicles in computer vision-related applications. Drones being used in applications like search and rescue, surveillance and military applications, demands automatic detection of human targets in large-scale images/videos recorded by UAVs. Small object sizes, large scale variations, dense distribution of objects, arbitrary orientations, class imbalance etc. are the major challenges exists in UAV-based small object detection. </p>


<p align="justify"> &emsp; A representative data set and the algorithms are the major requirements of small object detection. To enhance research in UAV and small object detection research community, we provide MIT UAV person detection video dataset comprising of 33 videos with 13462 sampled images and 153112 object instances with their annotations. The dataset is collected using two drone platforms DJI Mavic Pro and DJI Phantom at different locations in and around MIT campus under varying weather and lighting conditions.  The dataset contains a large number of small objects with varying scales, posture, and lighting, as well as occlusion, making human detection extremely challenging. </p>

<i> The sample images of our dataset with the annotations are shown below.</i>
